<section name="API Overview">

<p>The client toolkit API is fully described by the
<a href="apidocs/index.html" target="javadoc">javadocs</a>.
This section provides some pointers for deciding where to start looking
in order to use the toolkit for a particular purpose.
</p>

<subsection name="Implementing SAMP Client Functionality">

<p>If you have an application which you would like to provide SAMP
functionality, you should in most cases use the
<a target="javadoc"
   href="apidocs/org/astrogrid/samp/client/HubConnector.html"
                                          >HubConnector</a> class.
It is suitable for long-running applications which wish to
send and receive SAMP messages, and seamlessly handles registering
and unregistering with hubs, including taking care of the case in which
a running hub shuts down and another one starts up later
during the application's lifetime.
<code>HubConnector</code> provides some hooks for graphical capabilities,
for instance a <code>ListModel</code> which keeps tracks of other clients
and their attributes as the hub notifies of changes in them.
Some ready-to-use GUI components suitable for use with these hooks
are provided in the
<a target="javadoc"
   href="apidocs/org/astrogrid/samp/gui/package-summary.html"
                >org.astrogrid.samp.gui</a> package,
or you can roll your own.
</p>
<p>Short-lived applications, for instance ones which simply wish to register,
send a message and unregister again, may prefer to use the lower-level
<a target="javadoc"
   href="org.astrogrid.samp.client.HubConnection.html"
                                  >HubConnection</a>
interface directly.
</p>

<p>In either case, an instance of the
<a target="javadoc"
   href="apidocs/org/astrogrid/samp/client/ClientProfile.html"
                                          >ClientProfile</a> class
is used to initiate communication with the hub.
Currently, a single implementation of this,
<a target="javadoc"
   href="apidocs/org/astrogrid/samp/client/StandardClientProfile.html"
                                          >StandardClientProfile</a>,
is provided, corresponding to the SAMP Standard Profile.
However, other profiles could be implemented and used with the rest of
the API.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Running a SAMP Hub">

<p>The classes which provide the SAMP hub functionality are in the package
<a target="javadoc"
   href="apidocs/org/astrogrid/samp/hub/package-summary.html"
                >org.astrogrid.samp.hub</a>.
If you want to run a hub, either with or without a graphical display,
in most cases you can do it simply by using static methods of the
<a target="javadoc"
   href="apidocs/org/astrogrid/samp/hub/HubRunner.html"
                                       >HubRunner</a> class.
This hub can be embedded within a third party application if required.
For more configurability, for instance customising the graphical display or
hub discovery process, you may want to look at the other classes in this
package, perhaps with reference to the source code.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Control of Logging">

<p>The SAMPKit classes log activity using the J2SE 
<code>java.util.logging</code> classes.
Most messages are either at the 
INFO level (normal activity, e.g. details of each message sent/received) or the
WARNING level (errors, things which might be cause for concern).
If run under default settings, all of these messages will be written to
standard error for the application.  
It's easy to configure this behaviour otherwise however.
For details see the J2SE <code>java.util.logging</code> javadocs,
but the short story is: to restrict logging to WARNINGs only, do
</p>
<source>
    Logger.getLogger("org.astrogrid.samp").setLevel(Level.WARN);
</source>
<p>or to turn logging off altogether, do
</p>
<source>
    Logger.getLogger("org.astrogrid.samp").setLevel(Level.OFF);
</source>
