<p>SAMP Kit is a Java toolkit for use with the
<a href="http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/SAMP.html"
   >Simple Applications Messaging Protocol</a>.
It provides the following components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A SAMP hub implementation, suitable for standalone or embedded use</li>
<li>A set of classes which can be used to implement SAMP capabilities in
    client applications</li>
<li>A hub test suite, which can test correctness of third-party hub
    implementations</li>
<li>Utilities which can be used by client and hub developers, or SAMP users,
    to analyse or debug SAMP sessions</li>
<li>Graphical components built on top of the basic functionality suitable
    for use with the above</li>
</ul>
<p>For a given purpose, some or all of these components may be used at one time.
</p>

<p>The toolkit's design aims are, in rough order of priority:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctness according to the SAMP standard</li>
<li>Robustness</li>
<li>Ease of use for client application authors</li>
<li>Ease of deployment within third-party applications (few dependencies)</li>
<li>Flexibility, including the possibility to use with non-<em>Standard</em>
    SAMP <em>Profiles</em></li>
<li>Good documentation</li>
<li>Small size (in particular, few dependencies)</li>
</ul>
